# Darts Scorer

The aim of this repository is to create a library that allows for different games of darts to be scored. This will included both solo and team games.

There are a [lot of games](https://www.mastersofgames.com/rules/darts-rules.htm) that can be played on a dart bosrd and this package will include all of these.

A main difference with this library is it will be created using [GitHub Workspaces](https://githubnext.com/projects/workspaces), [Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot) and the other AI GitHub tools as much as possible. This will include the solution, C# projects, C# tests etc.

Ideally it will also add the GitHub Actions to:

* Build 
* Test 
* Publish
